Stupid poopoo weather thing i made out of boredom and to learn how to the apis in C

# Usage
Add your weatherapi.com api key in the API_KEY file and build with either
'make lmain' (for linux, copies executable to /usr/bin for convenience),
or simply 'make'

The program expects one commandline argument which is the name of any city
available on weatherapi.
